# Folder Monitoring Application

A Python application that allows you to monitor folder changes such as file and folder additions or deletions. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with `tkinter` and uses `watchdog` to monitor filesystem events.

## Features

- **Select Folder to Monitor**: Open a dialog to select a folder to monitor for changes.
- **Log Changes**: Displays real-time logs of file/folder creation or deletion in a same log window.
- **Monitoring Status**: View whether folder monitoring is active or inactive.
- **Stop Monitoring** and **start Monitoring**: Allows the user to stop monitoring and start monitoring as once selected folder or diffrent one.
- **Exit Application**: Gracefully stops monitoring and exits the application.
